// ticker is a ticker to power the alerting scheduler. it's like a time.Ticker, except:
// * it doesn't drop ticks for slow receivers, rather, it queues up.  so that callers are in control to instrument what's going on.
// * it automatically ticks every second, which is the right thing in our current design
// * it ticks on second marks or very shortly after. this provides a predictable load pattern
//   (this shouldn't cause too much load contention issues because the next steps in the pipeline just process at their own pace)
// * the timestamps are used to mark "last datapoint to query for" and as such, are a configurable amount of seconds in the past
// * because we want to allow:
//   - a clean "resume where we left off" and "don't yield ticks we already did"
//   - adjusting offset over time to compensate for storage backing up or getting fast and providing lower latency
//   you specify a lastProcessed timestamp as well as an offset at creation, or runtime
